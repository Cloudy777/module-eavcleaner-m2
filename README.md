# Magento 2 EAV Cleaner Console Command

Purpose of this project is to check for different flaws that can occur due to EAV and provide cleanup functions.

## Usage

Run `bin/magento` in the Magento 2 root and look for the `eav:` commands.

## Commands

* `eav:config:restore-use-default-value` Check if config admin value and storeview value are the same, so "use default" doesn't work anymore. Delete the storeview values.
* `eav:attributes:restore-use-default-value` Check if product attribute admin value and storeview value are the same, so "use default" doesn't work anymore. Delete the storeview values.
* `eav:attributes:remove-unused` Remove attributes with no values set in products and attributes that are not present in any attribute sets.
* `eav:media:remove-unused` Remove unused product images.
* `eav:clean:attributes-and-values-without-parent` Remove orphaned attribute values - those which are missing a parent entry (with the corresponding `backend_type`) in `eav_attribute`.
* `eav:config:restore-use-default-value` Check if config admin value and storeview value aren't the same and update config admin value from storeview value. Delete the storeview values afterwards.
